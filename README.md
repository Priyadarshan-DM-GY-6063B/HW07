# HW07: Drawing with Words

## Project Description

This project visualizes the quote:

> _"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."_  
> — Eleanor Roosevelt

Using **p5.js**, the visualization starts by displaying the quote in the center of the canvas in a typewriter-style animation. Once the full quote is displayed, interactive animations begin, bringing the words to life in a dynamic and engaging manner.

2. **Post-Display Animation**  
   - After the quote is fully displayed, words float upwards, symbolizing dreams rising.  
   - Special words like **"future," "believe," "beauty,"** and **"dreams"** are emphasized with glowing effects and dynamic sizing.

3. **Mouse Interaction**  
   - Words slow down and glow brighter when the mouse is near, making the visualization interactive.

4. **Polished Aesthetic**  
   - Smooth animations and clean layouts provide a professional presentation.

## How It Works

### Typewriter Effect

The typewriter effect displays the quote word by word in the center of the canvas. This ensures clarity and focuses the viewer’s attention. The timing of each word’s appearance is controlled to create a sequential reveal.

### Floating Word Animation

Once the typewriter effect completes:
- Words begin to float upwards gently, with slight horizontal drift for variation.
- Special words glow dynamically and interact with the mouse for emphasis.

### Mouse Interaction

Words respond to mouse proximity by:
- Slowing their movement.
- Glowing brighter to create an interactive and engaging experience.
